# orgmode-kmp

Kotlin Multiplatform library for parsing, formatting, and working with [Org
Mode](https://orgmode.org/) files and content. Check out the documentation
[here](https://lepisma.xyz/orgmode-kmp).

I am developing this for a few personal Android projects but am planning to
generalize this so this could be used in other places too. The parsers here are
based on parser combinators to focus on readability and maintenance over
performance.
