# orgmode-kmp

Kotlin Multiplatform library for parsing, formatting, and working with [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) files and content.

I am developing this for a few personal Android projects but am planning to generalize this so this could be used in other places too. The parsers here are based on parser combinators to focus on readability and maintenance over performance. Documentation will come soon.
